# Dear MOJANG Team

Written in front：
All of the following words come from Chinese translation may be wrong, please understand, thank you.
Hello, MOJANG team, `NetEase China Edition` of the current situation, you have the responsibility to manage, please read carefully, thank you<br>
<br>
I am glad to write this letter to you and feel lucky that you can see it.<br>
I come from China, a loyal regular player. I have some suggestions for you about Minecraft.<br>
<br>
I can also remember the fun I had from Minecraft. I've been attracted to this game from the first cube, the first craft item, the first online game. Openness, freedom, and creativity of Minecraft are unprecedented, this is why it will be the most fun game in the world.
In China's game market, some companies set up many fee-paying projects, what’s more, this projects are expensive. Minecraft just like a clear spring in the China's game market, it has no extra charge. It has an offline and official online, this is not limited to the players' economic conditions.<br>
<br>
Last year `NTES` represented the game, called Chinese Edition, but this was not  any Minecraft player wants. This game to be Chinese, add a variety of charge, it means stripping away the essence of the game. On August 8, 2017, `NTES` Minecraft Edition was officially open, but the response was unsatisfactory. In the BBS of `NTES China Edition`, about 90 percent of negative comments came in. The author of the Forge, denounced `NTES`'s behavior of Ignoring the copyright. `NTES` game department never respected any developer.  More importantly, the free MOD on the `NTES` network is added to the `NTES` China Edition box to collect fees (`RMB`).  Not even the author's information. There were tens of thousands of players to against `NTES`. From how I used to make a skin/MOD/resourcepacks bag to how I can buy a skin/MOD/resourcepacks, it was very ridiculous. The server of `NTES` my world, limited each player break to 20 block, if you want more, then you buy VIP.  Is this allowed by EULA? A large number of Chinese players use Hack to fight against <br>
Just as far as I know, there are no fewer than 40 QQ groups (40group*2000=80000 chinese players)<br>
`NTES` while `NTES` is powerless. The new player will be completely distorted by the `NTES` Minecraft Edition, so that new players can not recognize the real Minecraft .<br>
<br>
So we can think about that `NTES` doesn't understand what a player needs. `NTES` doesn't know how to make a good game. Not to mention how to represent Minecraft. That will make the game of Minecraft lose original purpose. On behalf of all of you and myself, appeal against the dealership of `NTES` of Minecraft. so Minecraft will be destroyed in the hands of `NTES`.<br>
